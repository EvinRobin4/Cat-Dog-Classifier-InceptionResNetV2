Cat-Dog Classifier Using InceptionResNetV2
Project Overview

This project is a deep learning-based image classification system that can distinguish between images of cats and dogs. It uses the InceptionResNetV2 pre-trained model to extract features from images, which are then used to predict the class (cat or dog).

The model achieves high accuracy on the dataset and can be used for real-time predictions on new images.

Features

Classifies images into Cat or Dog categories.

Built on TensorFlow/Keras using the InceptionResNetV2 architecture.

Easy to extend for more classes if needed.

Works with any dataset of cat and dog images.

Supports prediction from single images with visualization.

Dataset

The dataset used in this project includes:

Cats: 280 images

Dogs: 278 images

The dataset is divided into:

Training set: For model learning

Testing set: For evaluating model performance
